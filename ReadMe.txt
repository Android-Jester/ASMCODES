Various Steps Involved:

1:	Read in the search element(K).

2:	Compare 'K' to mid-element of stored array.

3:	If 'K' equals the mid-element, program outputs a message 		and the position where 'K' is found.

4:	If 'K' is less than the mid-element, program moves to the 		left side of the array to do a check.

5:	If 'K' is greater than the mid-element, program moves to the 	right side of the array to do a check.

6:	If 'K' is found amongst the elements in the stored array, the 	position of 'K' in the stored array is made known to user.

7:	If 'K' is not found, program displays to user a notice that 	the element is unavailable.
